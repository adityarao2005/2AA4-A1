**Question 1: Why is it preferable to use libraries such as Apache CLI or Log4J to support things like parsing the command line or printing log statements instead of writing code from scratch?**

It is preferrable to use Apache CLI and Log4J to support things like parsing the command line or printing log statements instead of writing code from scratch because it would support modularity, scalability, and portability. By using the code that someone else has created, tested, and proven to be effective, it reduces the risk of error in your part to implement a similar tool. When you need to support more features in your application say for example today you might need 2 command line arguments but tomorrow you may need 10, its always better to go with a standardizes and proven approach because these standardized approaches are meant to be scalable and reduce the chances of error. 

**Question 2: What are the advantages/inconveniences of using a logging approach?**
